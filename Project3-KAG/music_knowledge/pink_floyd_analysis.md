## The Concept Album Revolution

Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon," released in 1973, redefined what a rock album could be. More than a collection of individual songs, it represents a unified meditation on the human condition, exploring themes of conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. The album's conceptual coherence and sonic innovation established it as one of the most influential works in popular music.
